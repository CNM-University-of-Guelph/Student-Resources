# Installing VS Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free and lightweight code editor that's excellent for a wide range of programming tasks.  It's highly customizable through extensions, making it a versatile tool for data science and general software development. 

## Installation Instructions

1.  **Download VS Code:** Visit the official [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) website and download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2.  **Run the Installer:** The official install instructions can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview). Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.  The default settings are usually fine, but you might want to:
    *   **On Windows:** Check the box to "Add to PATH" so you can open VS Code from the command line.
    *   **On macOS:** Drag the VS Code application to your Applications folder.

3.  **Start VS Code:** After installation, launch VS Code.
