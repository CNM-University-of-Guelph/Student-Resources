# Installing RStudio

RStudio is a popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE) specifically designed for the R programming language. It provides a comprehensive environment for writing R code, performing data analysis, creating visualizations, and managing R projects. Note that while designed for R many other languages can be used in RStudio including Python.

## Installation Instructions

1.  **Download R:** Before installing RStudio, you need to have R installed on your system. Download the appropriate version of R for your operating system from the [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/) (The Comprehensive R Archive Network) website.

2.  **Install R:** Run the R installer and follow the on-screen instructions.  The default settings are usually fine.
    *   **On Windows:** select the base version of R
    *   **On macOS:** select the version based on your CPU architecture (Apple or Intel). If you are unsure about your hardware click the Apple logo in the top left corner and select "About This Mac". This will bring up a window that tells you the processor type.

3.  **Download RStudio:** Visit the RStudio website ([https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)) and download the RStudio Desktop version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

4.  **Install RStudio:** Run the RStudio installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Getting Started with RStudio

Once RStudio is installed, launch it.  You'll be greeted with the RStudio interface, which is divided into several panes:

*   **Source Editor:** This is where you write your R code.
*   **Console:** This is where you can execute R commands directly and see the results.
*   **Environment/History:** This pane shows the variables you've created and a history of the commands you've run.
*   **Files/Plots/Packages/Help:** This pane provides access to files, plots, installed packages, and help documentation.

For more information on the layout see [this page](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/ui-panes.html) from the RStudio documentation. The [getting started](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/get-started/) guide is a great place to start if you want to get familiar with R and RStudio.
