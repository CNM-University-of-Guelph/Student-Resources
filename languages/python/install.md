# Install Python

This page will guide you through installing Python on your system. A system installation places Python directly in your system files. While this might seem like the simplest way to get started, it has some drawbacks. Other software may conflict with the installation, and managing multiple Python versions can be challenging. For these reasons, you might want to consider using a [package manager](../../package_managers/package_managers.md) to help manage multiple Python versions and packages.  For most people it is probably best to get used to installing Python and packages this way.

## Choosing a Python Version

Python uses a versioning system to track its development. Versions are typically represented as X.Y.Z, where:

*   **X:** Major version (e.g., Python 3). Major releases introduce significant changes that might break compatibility with older code. Python *does not* guarantee backward compatibility between major versions.  Code written for Python 2, for example, will almost certainly not work on Python 3.
*   **Y:** Minor version (e.g., Python 3.9). Minor releases add new features or improvements while attempting to minimize breaking changes, though some incompatibilities can still occur.
*   **Z:** Micro version (e.g., Python 3.9.5). Micro releases usually involve bug fixes and security updates and are generally backward compatible within the same minor version.

**It's generally recommended to use the latest stable, *supported* minor version of Python 3 unless you have a specific reason to use an older one.**  Avoid pre-releases (alpha, beta, release candidate) unless you are interested in experimenting with new features, as they may contain bugs or change before the final release. If you will be using packages you may want to check their documentation for supported Python versions. It is always best to follow these guidelines to avoid errors in your code.

## Installation Steps

1.  **Download Python:** Go to the [official Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and select the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). The website should detect your operating system and suggest the latest stable release.

2.  **Run the Installer:** Once the download is complete, run the installer.

    *   **Windows:**  Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation. This will allow you to run Python from the command line.

3.  **Verify the Installation:** Open a terminal or command prompt and type `python --version` (or `python3 --version` on some systems).  This should display the installed Python version.
