# Welcome to the CNM Computer Science Resource Page!

This repo contains instructions and information for students that are new to computer/data science. The information is broken up into folders based on the topic. If you aren't sure where to start we would suggest first getting an [IDE](ide/ide.md) installed. After that you can find instructions for installing several different programing languages in the Languages folder. This should be all you need to get started!

This repo also has a collection of other resources that may be of interest. Learning how to use package managers can be very helpful, especially if you will be working with Python. If you are going to be working on a larger project you may want to learn about Git, a powerful version control software that can help you manage your project.
