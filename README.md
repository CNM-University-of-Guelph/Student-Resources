# Welcome to the CNM Computer Science Resource Page!

This repo contains instructions and information for students that are new to computer/data science. The information in this repository is organized into folders based on topic. You'll find pages covering how to install tools, write basic Python code, work with Git, and understand key programming concepts. Each section is designed to be beginner-friendly and can be explored in any order depending on what you're trying to learn. This should be all you need to get started!

If you are going to be working on a larger project you may want to learn about Git, a powerful version control software that can help you manage your project.
