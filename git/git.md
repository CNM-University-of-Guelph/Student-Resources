# Introduction to Git

Git is a version control system — a tool that helps you manage changes to your code over time. Think of it as a timeline for your project: you can track edits, go back to earlier versions, and collaborate with others without losing progress.

You don’t need to be an expert in Git to benefit from it. Even learning the basics can help you avoid accidental mistakes, back up your work, and keep your projects organized.


### **Why Use Git?**

Git offers several advantages that make it useful for both individual work and collaboration:

* **Version Control:** Git tracks every change made to your files. You can see what was changed, when, and by whom.
* **Undo Mistakes:** If something goes wrong, you can revert to a previous version of your code.
* **Backups:** Your code is stored locally, and optionally on a remote platform like GitHub, so it’s safe even if something happens to your computer.
* **Team Collaboration:** Git allows multiple people to work on the same project at once and merge their changes together.
* **Branching:** You can create separate “branches” to test new ideas or features without affecting your main code.


### **Key Concepts in Git**

If you're just getting started, here are a few terms you'll come across often:

| Term        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Repository (repo)** | A folder that Git is tracking. This is your project’s workspace.        |
| **Commit**   | A saved snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.              |
| **Clone**    | A copy of an existing Git repository, usually from a platform like GitHub. |
| **Push**     | Upload your changes to a shared or remote repository.                      |
| **Pull**     | Download the latest changes from a shared or remote repository.            |
| **Branch**   | A parallel version of your project you can work on independently.          |


### **Git vs GitHub**

It’s important to understand the distinction between Git and GitHub:

- **Git** is the version control software installed on your computer.
- **GitHub** is a website that hosts Git repositories in the cloud, making it easier to collaborate and share code.

You can use Git entirely on your own without GitHub, but GitHub becomes useful when you want to publish your code, work across devices, or collaborate with others.


### **When Should You Use Git?**

Even if you're just working on your own assignments or side projects, Git can be helpful:

* You can track your progress over time and undo changes if needed
* You can back up your work and avoid losing code
* You can prepare for real-world workflows used in companies and open-source projects

If you're working in a group or submitting to GitHub, using Git is almost essential.


### **How Do You Get Started with Git?**

If you want to start using Git, you’ll first need to install it. See [Git Installation Instructions](../../git/git_install.md) for help setting it up on your computer.

After installation, you’ll be able to:
- Initialize a repository in a project folder
- Save changes with commits
- Push/pull changes to/from GitHub if you're using one

We recommend using Git through your IDE (such as VS Code), which has built-in support for Git. This allows you to stage, commit, and sync your work using simple visual tools instead of typing everything in the command line.
